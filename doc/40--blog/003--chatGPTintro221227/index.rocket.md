# Bootcamper Alex Joiner showed off ChatGPT at Checkin today

What is this ChatGPT thing and what does it mean to us?

Ask Trevor about it, and he will point out that you won't want it do your assignments, because then you won't learn anything, and your bootcamp will be a meaningless expense.

But Trevor _will_ point out that you could use it to outline steps, as follows:

- Tell it you need the steps to approach the following problem
- Paste in the text from assignment 3

ChatGPT will return an outline of the steps, for you to code.

## Will ChatGPT be useful to us?

Here's a discussion from this day's checkin
