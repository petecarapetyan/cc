# Oglucan Presents both Final Projects

If you're wondering why you are working so hard to finish the bootcamp, here is your answer.

## Movies App - His 'formal' Final Project

Here are some of the questions that he answered in this recording:
- Comments protected from sql injection?
- What was the motivation for this app?
- How did store images in db?
- Did you use a template for the visuals?
- What was the trickiest part?  most difficult part?
- If movies api then why movies in db
- What api did you use and did you have to pay?

Additionally, he volunteered some of his own thoughts, such as:
- Changed up where I put my css to keep from getting bored 
- Did the api fetch in js rather than pumping it through the middle tier
- A distaste for the visual side of design didn't prevent a lot of data work on the front end
- Kept everything at java 11

## Chat App Upgrade - a second of many subsequent projects?

It can be confusing to those of use who struggle to do just one final project, but Ogulcan seems to find comfort in repetition?

By doing multiple projects in succession, each deployed live, each testing out various stacks and skill sets, Ogulcan is able to not only prove out his skill sets to the prospective interviewer, but also refine those places where he feels he has the best fit.

This app - essentially a massive upgrade on Assignment 14, is just one example.

## Plans for the future?

DM Ogulcan and ask him how he is approaching the future? Here are some questions you might ask him. Yes, he has answers. But you might learn as much from the discussion itself, as the answers.

- What stacks are you focusing on next?
- What ideas have been percolating in your brain for future projects?
- What is your strategy for applying to which jobs?
