# 3 Final Projects Presented in January of 2023

Final Project presentations continue to make for popular checkins in our CodersCampus bootcamp.

## More to Come!

There are other Final Projects in the works as this is being published, so you can count on each successive student learning just a little bit more from his/her predecessors and wiring that into the project.

This makes for an increasingly fun release schedule to come!

## Rob Gleason - React

Rob's project earns the moniker of "special" because he's the first to venture out and create a React front end for his Final Project

## Ercan Tekoglan - Using a Beautiful Template

This is a personal favorite, because Ercan combined his own work with a beautiful template.

## Mina Fahmy - with multiple selects

Notice how Mina goes above and beyond simple server side CRUD, with a client side multi-select.
