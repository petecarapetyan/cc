# How To Organize Your Workspace?

_**Be very thoughtful about where you put your projects and how you name them!**_

Get ready for an overwhelming number of projects! This is not just a bootcamp problem, this is what it is like to be a developer.

There is no way to be a developer - or a bootcamper - without lots of experiments, exploration, discovery and ... Starting a new project is how you explore something new.

## But First This: SEPARATE Projects for Every Assignment

That's the rule here. Every Assignment gets it's own git repository. 

Get that set up first before you even begin the assignment. This will save you much heartburn later, and is a frequent mistake with beginning students.

## Bad Side Effects to too Many New Projects

It's easy to get lost and confused when you have too much junk to sort through, and yesterday's project might be today's junk.

Don't let this happen to you.

## Strategy 1 - Workspace(s)

I keep a folder on my local box just for my CodersCampus projects. I hope you will too.

Developers tend to call folders of projects "Workspaces" and I have many workspaces for many different coding interests.

Later for example, if you develop an interest in React outside of bootcamp, you could create a separate folder - or workspace - for your experimental React projects.

## Strategy 2 - Naming Conventions

So many naming conventions, so little time to think about them. 

All your local workspaces won't help you on github - there, everything goes together in one big bucket. For now, you might not care, though.

For Assignments I use a1 or a7, or you can spell it out. You don't always have to put your name, but some will also put their name like _**"Billy_a3"**_

The big opportunity is Exercises! If you create a separate git project for every exercise you do, no one else will care - but you might! For example, _**"Week5_04_Pojo"**_ might help you find that project later if you need to reference it.

This is a personal affair - between you and yourself.

There are some strategies, however, to making it easy on yourself. Since this comes up on a lot of help calls, here are some of the awkward moments that you might wish to avoid.
