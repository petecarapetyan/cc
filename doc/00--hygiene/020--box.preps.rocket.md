# Preparing Your Computer for Successful Bootcamp

Will your computer (or "your box") support you well, in this bootcamp?

Here are some perspectives you might consider.

## Is Your Box Underpowered?

You may find your box adequate for some things and slow for others:

There are 3 major use cases that your computer needs to fit. One isn't as obvious as you might at first guess.

1. Writing code.
2. Running code, especially in more complex server setups
3. Running code and sharing your screen over zoom

- #1 is pretty easy - most any box will do, but an underpowered box might not run the required IDE as quickly.
- #2 might bump up against memory and processing power or memory limits on an old or underpowered box.
- #3 can be painfully slow if you are trying to share your screen, run the code, and get some help on zoom on an underpowered box.

The bottom line is that an older underpowered box might allow you to finish the course and get a job, but it could be much more difficult for you than the student with a faster more powerful box. Repetive tasks that take seconds could take minutes, and sharing over zoom might be almost impossible.

Sometimes we will advocate against trying to make do with an underpowered box, if there is a reasonable alternative, like borrowing a fast laptop from your uncle or cousin :)

## Fixing File Extension Visibility

This may be the most common problem with new bootcampers!
If your file extensions are not showing, your job as a developer is harder.

Both Windows and Mac may come set up to hide file extensions. Google search to find a solution to this problem, and get help from someone who is already set up, if google search doesn't get you what you need.

## Fixing Hidden Files/Folders Visibility

Developers use hidden files to store some of their data. Hidden is a file or folder that starts with a dot (.)

- .something.sh is a hidden file.
- something.sh is not a hidden file.

If you can't find any files or folders that start with a . in your file explorer then google for "show hidden files" and fix this problem.

## Issues if Your Box is a Mac

Welcome! A lot of developers use Macs - and you'll find them a top choice among the most senior developers worldwide.

There are two major considerations though - be sure to be aware of them.

1. The course is written in a Windows-centric way.
2. Consumer grade Macs might be underpowered especially on the memory side.

Neither of the above is a deal killer, but be aware of each. Adjustments might be required on your part - such as finding different editors than the Windows Notepad+ that Trevor uses in the course videos.

## Migrating to VSCode for HTML and CSS?

## Time Budget for Adapting to Zoom

If you don't already live on zoom like some of us (sigh) then there might
be some awkwardness on your first calls.

- Getting accustomed to muting when not talking
- Setting up speaker and microphone
- Learning which buttons to click for sharing your screen effectively
- Setting your name
- When to turn your video on and off
- Blurring background and using photos as a background

Rather than prescribing a how to for each of the above, perhaps it is just best to suggest budgeting some time and patience for your first meetings, until it becomes second nature.

## Choice of Browsers

There are plenty of great reasons for using or not using any browser, and this article will attempt to dodge that discussion as completely as possible.

The chrome browser appears to be the most universally used browser for developers, for many reasons.

- dev tools
- most common browser used by the consumers
- speed
- usually quickest to adopt new browser-standard features

If you use another browser, you still might wish to install chrome on your box for some development testing - if nothing else.
