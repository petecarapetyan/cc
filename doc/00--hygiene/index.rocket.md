# Set Up for a Strong Start

Get organized for a _**solid bootcamp experience**_

## Importance of a Strong Start

Experience has shown a surprising correlation - students who do not start strong seem to have a more difficult time finishing the bootcamp and getting that desired job in a timely manner.

The tips on these pages can help you get set up and organized to make a strong start more easily.
