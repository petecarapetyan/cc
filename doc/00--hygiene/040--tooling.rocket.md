# IDEs, shells, editors

Trevor will demonstrate an optimal path, in the video lessons:

- using defaults
- assuming a windows computer
- keeping things as straightforward as possible

The benefits of this approach cannot be understated. By limiting your options you are also greatly limiting your distractions. You stay on track, and remained focused on the task at hand.

This document will explore the benefits of expanding your horizons beyond these defaults.

## Defaults

Assumptions
- windows operating system
- Notepad++ for html, css, data
- Eclipse for Java

## What if you are on a Mac?

- Eclipse is still the default for java
- There is no Notepad++, so VSCode may be the best bet for HTML, CSS, and JS


## When to shift to other tooling?

- VSCode may currently be the best bet for HTML, CSS, and JS

more later on

- shell options
- linting
- plugins

## Historical progression of tooling
