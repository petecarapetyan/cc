# When to Ask for Help

Struggling with code is how you learn. When is it good to struggle on your own? When should you ask for help?

## Set a Time Limit

This only applies to narrow problems. Once you have divided your work up into narrow tasks, _**progress depends on getting through each narrow task.**_

Pick an arbitrary time limit. Half a day, or 4 hours, is a good example.

If you get stuck in one spot for more than half a day - ask for help.

## Who to Ask for Help?

Sometimes it is most practical to simply ask the instructor for a 1-1 to help you get un-stuck.

It can also be much more beneficial to you and your fellow bootcampers to ask _**each other**_ for help, for many reasons. But sometimes that is not practical, for example it could take longer, or the first person you might ask might not be helpful.

The culture here at Coders Campus leans strongly towards students working together to solve problems. This follows the pattern of teamwork that you will find in most successful company teams.

## Who Benefits When Bootcampers Ask Each Other?

Both parties benefit!

It is entirely possible, however, that the party that attempts to answer the question benefits much more - as it really stretches his knowledge and also his ability to articulate how things work.
