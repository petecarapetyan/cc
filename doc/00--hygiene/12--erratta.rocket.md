# Do This Instead

There are 3 places in the course that have changed since the videos were recorded.

## NOT SourceTree - Instead Github Desktop

In some places in the git videos, a reference is made to a program named SourceTree.

This was the first choice, when those videos were recorded.

Since that time, a program called Github Desktop has taken it's place as the first choice for bootcampers to use.

You are still free to use any program for git that you wish, but Github Desktop is the first suggestion for new git users, and the most widely supported in the desktop.

Others in the bootcamp may also use a command shell, but this is supported informally only and is not recommended for bran new programmers.

## NOT Notepad - Instead VSCode

In the video tutorials, Notepad++ is discussed as an editor for HTML and CSS files.

Whereas this is adequate for some situations, VSCode has been evolving in recent years to offer much more of a full featured experience for HTML and CSS. 

This includes automation of some of the file importing in HTML - a frequent source of pain for new HTML coders.

It also includes better color coding and content assist, and other such features.

One feature that is NOT recommended to be used in VSCode is the launch or run feature for HTML files - at least in this course. You are better off running the HTML file by simply "opening" it from the file menu in your browser, for this assignment.

It is also NOT recommended to run your Java assignments from within VSCode. Whereas this may work for the early assignments, we have yet to be convinced that it will handle the later assignments in an appropriate way, without some special tweaking. Use Eclipse for Java assignments.

## NOT JShell - Instead Eclipse

In Unit 2 Lesson 02 there is a reference to JShell, and some of the lesson is taught in JShell.

Whereas this works perfectly and is acceptable if you are an experienced java coder, you are recommended to use only Eclipse for java if you are a bootcamp student.
