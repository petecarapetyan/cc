# Which Check Ins should you attend?

There are different reasons for attending part, or all, of a checkin.

## What are the 3 Parts of a Check In?

1. _**Check In**_ to hold yourself accountable and build relationships
2. (Optional) _**Parking Lot**_ - for anyone stuck, needing help.
3. (Optional) _**Drill on REPS**_

## Can I Check In and then Leave?

YES!

Our culture makes it OK to just show up for the Check In portion - although it might be considered less than graceful to leave before everyone has had their chance to check in and be accountable.

## How Long do the Parking Lot Sessions Last?

Perhaps 75% of checkins - no one is stuck and there is no parking lots.

Other times there might be 3 people stuck and it takes the rest of the meeting to get everyone unstuck.

## Which Reps on Which Days?

- Monday early and late session - _**Interview Reps**_
- Tuesday, Wednesday - Thurs early sessions - _**CRUD Reps**_
- Thursday late and Friday sessions - _**Git Reps**_

## Is There a Benefit to Staying Through the Reps Drills?

It's all about how big an offer you want from your prospective employers.

If you want to have fewer interviews and higher offers once they learn how you skilled and articulate you are - then participate in more drill sessions going over the reps.

If you know everything about the topic of a checkin that could help you interview well, then don't worry about attending the drill sessions.

As instructor, I always target $10k - $20k better offers for those who attend sessions regularly and learn how to articulate what they know with precision and ease.
