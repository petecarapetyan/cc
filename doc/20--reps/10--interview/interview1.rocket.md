# Interview Drills - 1

These reps help you build a context around _**SELF PERCEPTION**_

Before you take your place in the world, sometimes it's a good idea to ask what place? And in what world?

## Who Am I to the Interviewer?

These are so fundamental that even your interviewer doesn't think about them. So let's define what it is that he/she doesn't even think about.

## Data Mangler

Your interviewer, his boss, and his boss's boss are all just like you, in this sense. Everybody has one central focus - managing the flow of data through the organization.

Data is what holds the organization together. That's why our role is so important.

## Code Mangler

To keep the data managed, we all use code. That's why you are being interviewed for your new job, because you code. 

So you have to decide, are you a coder? Or are you managing a bunch of code?

## 5 Pillars and CRUD

No, nobody on the job talks about 5 pillars or CRUD. By the time you get your new position, you are already slotted for a place in that bigger machine.

We talk about CRUD and the 5 pillars here - because that's how we focus our efforts in the bootcamp. We are learning enough to be placed inside that bigger machine.

- Learn enough to know what is expected of the various roles.
- Learn enough to know which role you might want to interview for.
- Learn enough to know how you will be judged as good enough to hire.

## Coder? What Code?

- How much are you expected to memorize?
- What is a reference coder?
- How are you evaluated as a first year coder?

## Full Stack? What Stacks?

- Which stacks do we specialize in at Coders Campus?
- Why these stacks?
- What are other stack sets?
- What flexibility do you need to have?

## Apps? What Apps?

- What does basic CRUD look like?
- How does basic CRUD compare to MANGA?

## Data? What Data?

- Which types of data are you expected to deal with?
- Do you need to memorize every type of data?
- Where does all this data come from?
- Where does all this data go?
