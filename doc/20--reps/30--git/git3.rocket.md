# Git Drills - 3

Git reps are mostly muscle memory reps around the repetive actions you wil take as a typical programmer on a typical enterprise team.

This session focuses on the absolute minimum steps to make a Pull Request into your own team's repository, especially re: branching.

## Git Team Contributions - To a Team You Belong To

Pre-requirements:

- You have been added as a collaborator to this repository
- You have cloned the repository to your local workspace

Drill:

- Identify issue or other naming convention to follow for naming new branch
- Make a new branch for this issue, from HEAD. Check out that branch.
- Make the desired change or contribution
- [externally HEAD should be changed to force next step]
- Pull from latest HEAD to make certain you have latest changes
- If related to an "issue" note that issue for your commit message.
- Commit to your local clone
- Push this new branch to the team's remote
- From github, make a Pull Request to project
- [Observe the Pull Request being processed by the project owner]
