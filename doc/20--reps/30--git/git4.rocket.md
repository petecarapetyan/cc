# Git Drills - 4

Git reps are mostly muscle memory reps around the repetive actions you wil take as a typical programmer on a typical enterprise team.

This session focuses on the absolute minimum steps to save your own work when you must stop, for example to help someone with another issue.

## Analyze Your Situation

### 1

Are you the only person currently working on the branch you are on? If this is the case, you can simply commit your changes to your local repository, if you want to keep the changes you have made so far.

### 2

Are you not ready to commit? You can stash your changes.

### 3

Are you one of several people working on this branch? You can stash your changes.

### 4

Do you want to commit, but maybe not to this branch? You can make another branch from this branch.
