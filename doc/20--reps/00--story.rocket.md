# Your Story

Our first job is to define how we hope to be viewed as a graduate. This defines our checklist, as we learn how to prepare ourselves for this set of expectations.

Once this is defined, we can spend our time in checkins working on the more advanced follow-ons to this same story.

## The CRUD or Full Stack Identity Story

  - I can code your data back and forth between user and where the data lives.
  - I can transform it, enhance it, filter it, secure it, move it around.
  - I can manage the coding process, and know how to work on a team.

## Some Obvious Limitations:

I only code in the most commonly used stacks among large worldwide organizations:

### My List of Stacks, So Far:

 - java
 - spring boot, spring security
 - maven
 - hibernate
 - thymeleaf
 - HTML CSS JS

### Stacks I Don'd Code in, Yet

- MEAN stack
- php laravele stack
- ruby rails stack
- python stacks
- react/vue/angular
- node express stacks
- reactive data approaches
- don't try to excel in painting pretty pictures with the data
- my skills are broad, and not deep (10k hours nope)

## Mapping to Specific Assignments

- a1 - User data (The browser client)
- a2 through a8 - basic Java and data handling
- a9 through a11 Spring Boot, Maven, Spring MVC
- a12 - SQL
- a13 - Thymeleaf, client side javascript
- a14 - Spring Security,
