# Reps

These drills focus on getting reps - or repetitive actions - around the things that you need to:

- Interview well, and confidently.
- Perform on the job, with ease - using what you have learned here.


## Introducing the 5 Pillars - by Trevor

From 0:30 to 5:30 on Trevor's video below - the discussion of the 5 pillars can help you prepare for much of what you need as a foundation for the reps linked below and at left. (Watching the entire video is not required.)

## Reps == Repetition == Muscle Memory

With these reps that we do as a team or a group, we are pumping skills and understanding deeper into our muscle memory.

## Reps Motivation

Let $ be your motivator. Think of yourself as attending reps sessions only to jack up your paycheck. A well rehearsed and well informed coder would almost always get a bigger paycheck, especially on your first job.

Reps on anything can be boring, because - by definition, they are [wait for it] repetitive. Coding reps are no different.

## Potential Benefits

- Get employed sooner.
- Inspire interviewers to offer you an extra $10k to $20k
- Increased confidence at interview time.
- Feel dramatically more solid on the job.
- Get that first raise sooner/bigger.

How do we know that these are possible? Because when our graduates have this extra experience, we have seen one or more of these happen.

It is a top priority for every bootcamper to have this opportunity.

## Scheduling Notes

There are 2 sessions each for Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays. This allows you a second choice, when one schedule doesn't work.

We can also arrange other approaches when required:

- **1-1 sessions** whenever the team approach isn't the right one
- **Specially scheduled slots** such as might be necessary for European or other differences.
