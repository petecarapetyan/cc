#### COVERED IN THE LESSON

- properties of object can be of the class or of Object
- yada.foo where yada is class and foo is property references property
- yafa.foo = "whatever" assigns a property
- syntax: must backslash a double quote to use it inside a String
- `System.out.println(objectReference)` prints the objects memory location by default which calls the object's toString() method;
- to see how the java language itself is written, view TypeHierarchy and drill down inside the java code itself
- each instantiations of a class resolves to a different memory location on computer
- at this point the student can instantiate an object and set it's properties
