# Drills vs Unit Test

Drills and Unit Tests are typically different things entirely. 

- _**Testing**_ humans is _**not**_ something that Unit Tests are typically used for.
- _**Training**_  humans is something that Unit Tests are a natural fit, for. Because Unit Tests are designed to be almost rigid in what they do.

## How Does It Work?

First, what are Unit Tests? You will learn more about the more typical usage of [Unit Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) when you do the Unit 11 and Assignment 7.

The way these drills work is by forcing you to _**complete Unit Test code**_.

Adapting Unit Testing to drills makes use of JUnit's relative inflexibility to force you to think through an answer in terms of what it takes to complete a specific task. JUnit, in this case, is the tool that keeps you on the straight and narrow path.

## A Double Win?

Yes, there is a double win by using JUnit, or Unit Testing, as a tool for forcing you through drills.

The most valuable coders in every field are _**quite often the coders that make regression tested code a natural skill.**_ But learning to get past the tedious nature of writing Unit Tests can take a few days, just to get in the rhythm of it. More experienced coders never make it through this burn-in period. It's just too tedious.

So spending your earliest Java days in deep in the bowels of Unit Testing will make you a much more useful developer - both to yourself, and to your employer!
