#### COVERED IN THE LESSON

- reminder: These concepts transferrable across similar OO languages
- TIP: MUST MEMORIZE parts to a method include (optional) visibility modifier, return type, methodName, parameter requirements and their type, and scope
- compiler checks that actual returned is same data type as data type specified
- to combine Strings into one String, use the `+` to "concatenate" multiple Strings
- it is OK to break up a line of code on the `+` character, for example
-  TIP: MUST MEMORIZE method shown as a way to re-use same block of code instead of copyPasting same code multiple times!!!!! To reduce code duplication.
- by "extracting" code and placing it inside the scope of a method
