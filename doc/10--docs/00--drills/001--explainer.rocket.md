# Drills - Explainer

These drills are designed to literally _**stop you in your tracks**_ if you try to move to the next lesson before you learned everything in this lesson.

## How Does It Work?

Drills are awkwardly composed in the context of [Unit Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing). This is not a match made in heaven.

- Unit Tests are not really made for training human behaviors and understanding.
- It is kinda tricky just to describe what it is that the coder should do.

If the bootcamp student can look past these challenges, speed is how one knows if the material is learned. If one can generate and then code the same drill ten times in a row at breakneck speed, one pretty nearly knows that this material is "learned".

## More Specific Instructions

Each drill may or may not be accompanied with specific instruction sets, such as [U2L03](/docs/drills/U2L03/)

## Future Plans

The current version is already the 3rd version of these drills and still far from what we would like to see.

Future plans might or might not include:
- Continued addition of more and more drills
- Delivered in the form of an Eclipse Plugin with automatic refresh
- Easier to use
- [Your suggestion here]
