# U2L04 - long

This lesson drills what Trevor teaches in _**U2L01, U2L02, U2L03 and**_ U2L04

So if some of this is confusing, be sure to review any of the 4 lessons, to clarify what is drilled below.

## Pre-requirements:

- You have performed previous drills to reach a top speed, and then repeated top speed 10x
- Follow this for all  [drills explainer](/docs/drills/explainer/)
- Or this if you haven't even installed the drills yet [installation](/docs/drills/install/)

## Summary of what is drilled

1. Everything mentioned in U2L03
8. Long suffix notation
9. Long and int min and max values
10. Overflow behavior on int max value
11. Formatting with an underscore in a number

## Whew! That's a lot to cover for the second drill!

In addition, we are only using unit testing for the second time.

For all these reasons and more, you may wish to reach out to an instructor or a video or another student in order to get through this first drill the first time. 

Also for that same reason, you may wish to regenerate and repeat this drill _**many many times**_ until it feels really solid.

## Process: Follow same general process as U2L03
