String Manipulation

there is already an exercise for this so priority should be modesltly lower

- Includes teaching about for loop using array of something for(Yada yada: yadas)
- Includes teaching about consuming String[] args input from main - do this on your own
- main idea is to call the split method on a string and get an array of strings
- multiple are shown, comma, dash
- multiple ways of iterating through this but for(Yada yada: yadas) is primary
