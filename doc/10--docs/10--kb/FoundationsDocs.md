```This is going in the sidebar for docs before Assignment 1```

## Java Programming Fundamentals

### Variables
- assigning
    - setting values
### Creating a method
- return values
- void
- returning objects
- parameters
### Creating a class
- instantiating a class
- Class class = new Class();
### Loops
- for loop
- while loop
- enhanced for loop 
    - for each
### If statements / Conditionals
- if, if else, else
### IO operations
- scanning input in console
- writing and reading to files
### Sorting
- comparator, comparable
### Wrapper Classes
- int vs Integer
- bool vs Boolean, etc
### POJO
### String Operations
- manipulation
- parsing, splitting
### Inheritance
- extend, implements keywords

## Git/ Github
- Create remote repository on github.com
- clone remote to local (open code in github desktop)
``` include pictures if necessary ```
- add your code to local (can copy and paste if you already created the code)
- don't forget to commit and push

## Problem Solving Principles
- Where to look for solutions
- Create a roadmap to the solution

### Google
- StackOverflow
- GeeksforGeeks
- Baeldung
- YouTube
- W3Schools

### Documentations
- Java Docs
    - Oracle
- Tutorial Point
    - has Java documentation
- MDN
    - has huge library of documentation for web developers
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

### Code in English first
- Pseudocode
    - what are you trying to accomplish
    - what classes, methods, variables, etc, do you need
    - what will these do?
    - then try and write code after it makes sense to you

### Peers
- The above not work? Try asking your peers next.
    - Give detailed description of issue
    - video and pictures are good
    - Github Repo is best (copy and paste your github repo link in the slack)
